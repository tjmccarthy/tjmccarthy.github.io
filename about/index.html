<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

My name is Trevor McCarthy. I have just finished up getting my BS in Computer Science and am eager to begin work in any
related fields. With my previous occupation involving multi-unit management in retail, I excelled in the testing and 
implementation of new processes. Who doesn't enjoy tying new ways to solve old problems?

I am proficient in Java and am passionate about software development. In addition to Java, I have experience in using Python,
C, and the HP Prime programming language(HPPP). I enjoy projects involving Raspberry Pi/Arduino or any other embedded systems.
I look forward to utilizing my leadership and analytical skills and am considering employment opportunities in all 50 states.
