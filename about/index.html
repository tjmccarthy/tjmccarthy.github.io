<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

My name is Trevor McCarthy. I have just finished up getting my BS in Computer Science and am eager to<br>
begin work in any related fields. With my previous occupation involving multi-unit management in retail,<br>
I excelled in the testing and implementation of new processes. Who doesn't enjoy trying new ways to solve<br>
old problems?<br>
<br>
I am proficient in Java and am passionate about software development. In addition to Java, I have experience<br>
in using Python, C, and the HP Prime programming language(HPPP). I enjoy projects involving Raspberry Pi/Arduino<br>
or any other embedded systems. I look forward to utilizing my leadership and analytical skills and am considering<br>
employment opportunities in all 50 states.<br>
