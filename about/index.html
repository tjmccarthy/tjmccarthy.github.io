<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

My name is Trevor McCarthy. I am a full-time student at the University of Texas at El Paso working toward my Bachelors in Computer Science.
With my previous occupation involving multi-unit management in retail, I excelled in the testing and implementation of new processes. My 
guilty pleasure always involved the technology aspect of the business.

I am proficient in Java and am passionate about software development. In addition to Java, I have experience in using the HP Prime
programming language. (HPPP) I enjoy the occasional dabbling in network security testing via Raspberry Pi projects, 3d modeling with 
Blender and using Unity to develop applications for my Samsung Gear VR. I look forward to utilizing my leadership skills in the tech 
industry upon graduation and am currently considering internship opportunities.
