It's a new year with plenty of objectives to conquer. Among them is turning this 4-month-old blank page into something functional while
migrating and consolidating information posted on some of the “create your own domain” sites. It’s nice to at least get a little use out
of my first degree. Funny that in the 15+ years HTML has stayed about as static as the student loans. (At least for the barebones
implementations I remember.) I plan to dabble in JavaScript a little to make things more entertaining to look at before classes start
back up. For now, I will be using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Markdown for posting infrequently.
