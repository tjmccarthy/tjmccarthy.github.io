For a couple days, I have been enjoying the revisiting, repurposing and sometimes repolishing of some of my old class projects. Sifting
through piles of old flash drives and multiple cloud accounts to organize and purge shares some semblance with cleaning the garage. The
latter being far less time consuming due to a smaller number of tangible keepsakes and sparse levels of sentimental attachment for them.
However, the humor and gratification are a solid tradeoff for the time needed to delete the same program stored and renamed 9 times over.

The amount of “set it and forget it” options available are stammering and it is unlikely the ecosystems of Google, Microsoft, Samsung and
Amazon will ever completely play nice together. Don’t get me wrong, cloud saving has been a godsend on the off occasion a hard drive
bricks. Settings like these clearly are not the problem. Some programs I just can’t delete. The ones that are poorly written are not only
funny to see but a good way to monitor progress. One of my favorites is one-liner to solve binomial coefficients written in HPPP. 
(Programming language for the HP Prime calculator.) This calculator can do derivatives, integrals and yes…has multiple functions for 
handling binomial coefficients.

As faux pas as it is in programming to do more work in reinventing the wheel, diving in and familiarizing yourself with new programming 
language to solve a problem is invigorating. Even if you aren’t the first to come up with the solution.
